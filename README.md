# Sea ice thickness uncertainty notebook

Jupyter Notebook to showcase the conversion of ICESat-2 sea ice freeboard (ATL10) to sea ice thickness, including random/systematic uncertainity estimates.

Produced as part of OceanUQ, a US CLIVAR Working Group on uncertainty quantification in ocean observational and model data.

You can launch the notebook using binder:
